## Project Description  
This is an **advanced Excel VBA automation project** designed to simulate a **3-step manufacturing workflow** (Cutting â†’ Assembly â†’ Finishing) and support **production planning, forecasting, and cost optimization**.  

### Key Features  
- Automates creation of **Calendar, Forecast, Cost Summary, and Dashboard**  
- Simulates ERP-style planning with **batching, onboarding limits, and milestone bonuses**  
- Provides **decision-support** by combining operational scheduling with cost analysis  
- Demonstrates how **Excel VBA can replace manual processes** and reduce bottlenecks

## Project Output

When the macro runs, it automatically generates **four outputs** in the workbook:

### ðŸ“… Calendar
- Lists each client, their batch, and the exact dates for the three production steps (Cutting, Assembly, Finishing).  
- Helps managers see **who is scheduled, and when**.  

### ðŸ“Š Forecast
- Shows monthly totals: **how many steps** are needed and **how many clients** are completed cumulatively.  
- Provides a **capacity planning view**.  

### ðŸ’° Cost Summary
- Calculates **monthly production costs, handling costs, and total costs**.  
- Flags when the **bonus** (after 10 clients completed) is triggered.  

### ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard
- A chart of **Monthly Production Steps**.  
- Gives a quick **visual overview of workload across months**.

## Key Business Insights  
- **Workload Balancing** â†’ Initial month has heavy load, stabilizes afterward  
- **Cost Dynamics** â†’ Costs increase with production steps, bonus reduces net cost after 10 clients complete  
- **Predictability** â†’ 2-week intervals provide clear handoffs for planning  
- **Decision-Support** â†’ Tool allows testing different batch sizes, onboarding limits, and cost structures  

---

## Recommendations  
- Use this tool for **scenario testing** (e.g., onboarding 6 vs. 10 clients/month)  
- Add a **cumulative clients vs. target chart** to highlight progress  
- Integrate outputs into **monthly management reporting**  

---

## Known Issues & Bugs (Identified)  
- **Date Calculation** â†’ Uses `"ww"` (weeks). Safer to use `"d"` for exact day offsets  
- **Hardcoded Clients** â†’ Fixed at 18; should be dynamic  
- **MaxClientsPerMonth** â†’ Input exists, but not implemented in scheduling logic  
- **Bonus Logic** â†’ Triggers once; doesnâ€™t handle recurring bonuses  
- **Array Performance** â†’ `ReDim Preserve` is slow for large datasets  

---

## Future Enhancements  
- Add **error handling** for missing or invalid inputs  
- Enforce **Max Clients per Month** constraint  
- Make **Total Clients dynamic** (remove hardcoding)  
- Add **salary increments** for workforce cost modeling  
- Provide a **user-friendly button or form** for one-click forecasting  
- Connect to **live data sources** (SQL, SharePoint) for automation  

---

## Tools & Skills Used  
- **Excel VBA** â†’ Advanced macros, dynamic arrays, automation  
- **Data Modeling** â†’ Batch scheduling, cost aggregation  
- **Visualization** â†’ Dashboard charts for planning  
- **Business Analytics** â†’ Production planning & cost control
